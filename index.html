		<h1>Hi there, I'm Chris!</h1>
		<p>I'm a Full-Stack Web-Developer.</p>
		<p>After brief stints as a British Army Officer and in the Financial Services, I studied at <a href="https://www.makersacademy.com"><em>Makers Academy</em></a> and discovered a new super power. This is a blog-space to document my journey into the world of software development.</p>
		<p>Thanks for coming with me!</p>
