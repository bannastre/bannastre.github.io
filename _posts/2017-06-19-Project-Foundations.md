This week, dubbed 'Project Week', was a chance for us to consolidate what we have been learning over the last 6 weeks. It was also a chance to let loose as a self-guided development team for the first time.

In truth, this was more difficult than I had expected. I have a some experience of leading teams in pretty challenging environments, but this was different. The project was complex, for a start, introducing great potential to spin off and implement a bunch of features. We also had a choice of tools, languages and frameworks, another opportunity to start learning something new by doing.

This freedom was our undoing. Without going into too much detail and in order to salvage the learning from our experience, I wanted to note down the things that we would do differently at the off. Future me will be looking back at this for sure. (Hi, future Chris!).

So here goes...

#### 1. Do an initial kick-off:  
- Establish what went well from the last project and what was difficult.
- Sign up to a charter for the project, getting buy and commitment to the project rules.
- Separate out setup items into pairs.
- Take some time to understand and discuss what project tools we might need.

#### 2. Structure the Workflow:  
- Pre-determine pair-swapping etiquette (eg. event or time driven?).
- Use a tool for managing workflow from the off in the Kanban style.
- Waffle.io is such a tool, Trello is another and Github has its own 'Projects' built in.

#### 3. Define rules for interacting with the Master repo:  
- Discuss what constitutes a "worthy commit"
- Pull master branch to your own prior to any pull request.
- Resolve git merge issues on remote.

#### 4. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate:  
- Establish 'Stand-up' routine -> 0900hrs and 1400hrs.
- Slack with Github / Waffle integrations.
- Sit near each other, run ideas past the team, get input for the bigger decisions, share jokes.

At the very least, give the team a name. This is not only for fun, it allows the team to engage with each other creatively and build consensus.

Hopefully that acts as a basic skeleton and details just _some_ of the things that a newly formed project team can do to build as a team.
