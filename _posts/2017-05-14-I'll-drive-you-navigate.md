Hidden behind a bus stop, a stone's throw from Spitalfields market, stands an unsuspecting door. On entering the lift, with it's one flickering light gently reassuring me that we are still ascending, I am delivered to Makers Academy.

Day 1 starts with a welcoming breakfast in the converted warehouse that is Makers HQ. Any awkwardness is dispelled immediately while we gather in the kitchen (as is customary at all social engagements) after which our coach corals us in one of the larger wooden floored, brick walled learning spaces.

The big take-away for today, and the title subject of this post is most likely to be the central pillar of my Dev-Education. Pair Programming, or pairing, is quite simply a technique that allows programmers to work together on a single project. It's a social skill in itself and as I have more than once been called out for struggling in silence, I hope pairing is a way for me to overcome that and generally be more collaborative.

Pairing is not just splitting tasks and sharing the load, though. There is a structure (actually there are a range of structures) and a set of roles and responsibilities that make it work. The rules, which were set down in 1996 by the [Extreme Programming movement](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html) are simple.

Two developers sit side by side in front and share a single computer, one a Driver and the other a Navigator. The Driver has the keyboard and is responsible for inputs to the code, deciding 'How' it is interpreted. The Navigator observes and critiques, taking care of the 'What'. As the project advances, the roles switch at regular and pre-determined intervals.

For my part, I have found a fluid approach to switching works best. I have found a combination of switching after each Github commit with time-limiting each coding session. I won't be the first to have spent hours staring at a problem fruitlessly, then to [take a few minutes](https://open.buffer.com/science-taking-breaks-at-work/) away from the screen to find the solution at the bottom of a cup of coffee.

Makers Academy is, after only one day, my new home. It immediately strikes me that this is no ordinary bunch of students. This bunch, this Cohort, is a collection of like minds and of incredible talent. It's going to be a fascinating 12 weeks...
