That's embarrassing, it's been a long time since I posted anything...

So I thought I'd kick off the blog again. I'm now a year in to my new career as a coder and it's been an EPIC story so far. Before I regale you with tales of wonder and learnings from the year that was, I'd like to share a review I wrote for [Makers](https://makers.tech/) back in February. Re-reading today, I still believe everything I said holds true so If you're thinking about changing your life, have a read.

If you're reading this review you're probably in the same place I was; stagnant in one career, eager to level-up, interested in coding... fundamentally needing to change something. Did Makers Academy satisfy that brief? In short, yes it did, but what use is a short review.

Let me start by saying, be under no illusion about the pure intensity of the course. It's really 16weeks long if you count the month-long, remote-learning pre-course. I tried to complete my pre-course whilst working full time. It's not easy. In fact it's foolish to suggest it can be done to any great effect when distracted by the very thing you're looking to leave behind.

In my view, if you're not willing to give 7days to the course for the full 16weeks then don't apply. That may seem harsh but I challenge you to find any other opportunity to change your life in such short time. You will want to dedicate every waking hour to it.

It struck me was how much attention was paid to detailed crafting of the learning environment. The demographic mix of the cohort requires that there is zero tolerance of cliques, prejudice or inappropriate language of any sort, which only serves to reinforce the safety of the space. Knowing that the atmosphere is one of total acceptance empowers you to learn at the fastest possible pace... and you'll need to.

The third thing to highlight is the course content. Like a number of bootcamps the focus is on Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming, which is tried and tested. It's fun, showcasing some real world applications and the challenge based approach is packed full of re-affirming feedback. Ruby is a great language to learn in and is again common to a range of Boot Camp options.

The key differentiator for Makers, however, is that at its core, the course is language agnostic. You'll learn how to identify the methods, tools or languages you don't know and subsequently how to bring yourself up to speed. This is undoubtedly the most useful thing I learned and is an essential developer skill.

So there must be some negatives. Well there's the Â£8,000 you'll need to stump up. 
You're not going to be able to recoup that anytime soon with Developers wages in London lagging way behind the US. If Makers found a way to remove that barrier whilst keeping "skill-potential" entry criteria high, the course would be an attractive proposition indeed.

Makers Academy is Europe's leading web development Boot Camp for a reason. It's highly selective because the course will take you from next-to-zero knowledge to a skilled professional in a matter of weeks. You'll be prepared with a solid understanding of coding best practice and the added safety-net of a team of hiring partners ready to help and push you towards your first job as a Junior Developer.

I owe a great deal to my fellow Makers Alumni and everyone who supported me through my course. Life-changing is a cliched and over-used term but this is a truly transformative course.
